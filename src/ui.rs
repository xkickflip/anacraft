//! The full-screen live dashboard (`anacraft dash`), built on ratatui.
//!
//! Everything on screen moves. Values ease toward their new targets instead of
//! snapping, bars keep a mining edge while they are still filling, the realtime
//! count is polled on its own faster cadence, and arrivals since the last poll
//! scroll past as a feed — so the panel changes between report refreshes rather
//! than sitting frozen for thirty seconds at a time.
//!
//! Network work runs in spawned tasks and lands over a channel; the frame loop
//! never awaits the API, which is what keeps the animation smooth across a slow
//! request.
//!
//! The one-shot commands render ANSI strings directly; those can't be reused
//! here because ratatui needs styled spans, so the block-drawing helpers are
//! reimplemented against `Line`/`Span`.
